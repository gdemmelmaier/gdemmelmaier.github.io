## In this repository, I present three projects I have participated in. 

**SML Spotify Analyser** is a ML project where a person listened to 750 songs and labeled them with 'like' or 'dislike'. Using Spotify's open API's connected to the songs, we could use machine learning to predict if the person would like or dislike a new song he had never heard of. 

**StrategicGame** is a project in three parts, a game interface, a communication platform and a game engine. The game engine is a bot that uses a tree algorithm to calculate what move to do next in the game. 

**VasaloppetDigitalMedals** is a JavaScript project. Skiers in Vasaloppet where awarded with digital medals depending on their performance in the real race. Graphically visualized at my friends Erik's webpage: https://eriksmapp.com/#/vasaloppet
