# UU-game by Pay-2-Win
Welcome to our small UU game. It was developed for the group project in _Software Engineering and Project Management_ at Uppsala University, Spring 2020. 

## How to play the UU game
For this game you need two computers within the same WiFi. Sadly, Eduroam is not supported. Start the server by running
```Bash
cd projectse
python -m Server
```
on the Server-Computer. When asked for an IP-Adress, give the IP4-Address of that computer.

To run the game on the player's computer, run
```Bash
python -m main
```
When asked for an IP-Adress, Give the IP4-Address of the Server.

The game can also be played on the same computer within 2 different consoles.

Decide what game mode you want to play and enjoy! The game supports a Player vs Player mode, as well as Player vs AI and a tournament mode.
The rest of the game should be self-explanatory, but you can always type `R` during the game to get the rules.

Enjoy playing!
